Please answer the following questions after you have completed the programming lab. Write your answers in complete sentences and provide thoughtful responses.

## Comprehension Questions

1. What is the purpose of breaking a program into functions? How did this help you in completing the lab?

Your Response:

The purpose of functions is to the the main cleaner and have sections of program that you can repeat and use again and again. For this lab it just helped simplify the whole lab itself


2. Describe how you validated user input in your version of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Why is input validation important?

Your Response:

I went with the numbers convered to text. I used a command that checked if the number was an option and if it was it took it if it wasn't it prompt you again. This is important so the program has a value that it can actually work with.

3. How did you use comments and docstrings in your code? Give an example of a helpful comment or docstring you wrote.

Your Response:

I just use comments as little notes to myself, like stickynotes. I'm not the best with adding comments so this is how I do it. One was a reminder to add color to the code.

4. Explain how the computer's move is generated in your program. What Python features did you use to accomplish this?

Your Response:

I used "computer_choice = random.choice(choices)". For this random was inported. It assigns one of the three choices randomly to the computer_choice value. 

5. What was the most challenging part of refactoring the spaghetti code into a more structured program? How did you overcome this challenge?

Your Response:

The most challenging part was just trying to understand the set up of it all. I overcame this by going over it again and again until I got it.

## Ethical Reflection Questions

1. Why is it important to write code that is easy for others to read and maintain? How does this relate to your responsibilities as a programmer?

Your Response:

It's important because it won't be just you working on the program. It will be many and they have to be able to do their jobs as well.It's a person's responsibilty to not hinder their team.

2. Consider the use of open source code (like the spaghetti code provided). What are some ethical considerations when using, modifying, or sharing code written by others?

Your Response:

A consideration is to not just copy it all and pass it off as your own. You can use code but make sure to use it just as a reference or at least credit the original code.
